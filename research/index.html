    <h3>Multi-Agent Teamwork in Search for Smart Opponents Detection</h3>
    <p>
        In our works we have shown and quantified (for specific problems) gains obtained from carrying out a mission by
        a team of cooperating agents. The techniques developed can be applied in a variety of domains including planning
        against adversarial opponents, control of forest fires and search-and-rescue missions. A significant part of my
        Ph.D. work investigates team cooperation and planning under uncertainty in multi-agent search tasks,
        specifically for guaranteed detection of smart opponents. A smart opponent is an opponent that can perform
        optimal evasive maneuvers meant to avoid its interception. For these types of problems a "must-win" strategy is
        developed to ensure detection of all opponents in a region of interest. Our novel search methods and performance
        analyses are theoretically and experimentally proven for any number of searchers. Our State-of-the-art results
        on these subjects are available at:

    <h3>Urban Air Traffic Management of Autonomously Flying Vehicles</h3>
    <p>
        This part of my research concentrates on algorithms for safe and efficient multi-agent team cooperation under
        uncertainties. The study elaborates on a topic paramount for the advancement of large-scale traffic management
        algorithms for autonomous vehicles. We discuss urban air traffic management algorithms for futuristic
        autonomously flying vehicles by considering interactions between vehicle-like agent, where the term agent refers
        to an entity moving in the environment such as a vehicle. The investigated methodologies may be applicable to
        traffic management of autonomous ground vehicles as well. For more in depth details of my research on these
        topics see:

        For a preliminary version of an extensive survey we conducted on behalf of the Israeli Smart Transportation
        Research Center that investigates the current state-of-the-art in models and algorithms across
        many domains of intelligent transportation systems, see .

        The findings were used to identify knowledge gaps in relevant areas of interest for further investigation.

    <h3>Bio-Inspired Robotics</h3>
    <p>
        In this research we analyze locust trajectories in order to understand and model movements of locust swarms. The
        objective of this research is to assist in developing bio-inspired robotic technology by learning insect modes
        of locomotion towards bio-inspired locomotion. To this end, I developed a computer-vision and deep learning
        based multi-object video tracker, based on the principles of tracking by detection and association. It offers
        precise tracking for extremely long time horizons with state-of-the-art results on the problems of bio-inspired
        robots and insect tracking in dense environments. To achieve this goal, a new computer-vision software tool,
        called LocusTracker was developed for locust trajectory prediction. The tool enables tracking individual locusts
        in selected environments for very long time horizons of several hours without the usage of physical markers on
        individual locusts.
